# Locally Imagined

Locally Imagine frontend

## Description

Locally Imagine is an online marketplace for artists to post artwork for sale. We build this project for artists who wish to browse and trade local art but donâ€™t want to go to physical galleries. Locally Imagined both complements and evolves the status quo of the local art trade by enabling online transactions of local art.

## Features

1. Users can browse different artworks from different artists in the gallery.
2. Users can create their own accounts and log in.
3. Users can browse different types of artworks based on medium and date.
4. Users can customize their profile with an avatar and bio.
5. Users can edit/delete their artwork.
6. Users can view the buyers' contact information if they are interested in their artworks.
